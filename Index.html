    <h3 id="test">Uruguay were knocked out of the World Cup on goals scored despite beating Ghana 2-0 after South Korea's dramatic win against Portugal.</h3>

    <p>It was all to play for heading into the final Group H matches and Uruguay thought they 
    done enough in the first half as Flamengo midfielder Giorgian de Arrascaeta scored twice in quick succession.
    
    </p>

    <p>They were the first goals Uruguay had scored in the group stages, and it proved to be pivotal to their World Cup exit.</p>

    <p>With just minutes to play at the Al Janoub Stadium, Uruguay remained second behind Portugal, but a late South Korea winner from Wolves' 
    Hee-Chan Hwang against Portugal saw them depose the South Americans on goals scored - netting four to Uruguay's two.</p>

    <p>It meant Uruguay needed just one goal to fire them into the last-16 on goal difference as eight minutes of added time was shown.</p>
