    <h1>Jakub Kiwior is at London Colney to finalise Arsenal move - journalist</h1>

    <p>Arsenal are about to complete the signing of Jakub Kiwior, just a day after they announced the arrival of Leandro Trossard from Brighton and Hove Albion.</p>

    <p>The Gunners spent the first half of the January transfer window trying to sign Mykhaylo Mudryk. After that deal collapsed, Edu Gaspar accelerated his other plans, and they’re coming to fruition now.</p>

    <p>
        Watts has just revealed on Twitter that the 22-year-old, who has been branded as ‘extraordinary’ by Robert Lewandowski, is now at London Colney to finalise his move.</p>

    <p>He’s set to spend the afternoon at the Arsenal training centre and will be meeting his new teammates.</p>

    <p>Watts tweeted: “Jakub Kiwior spending the afternoon at London Colney finalising his move and meeting his new Arsenal team-mates.</p>

    <p>“Finishing touches being put on the transfer. Busy couple of days at Arsenal.”
