    <p>Mykhaylo Mudryk made his Chelsea debut today at Liverpool and he impressed in a cameo off the bench at Anfield this afternoon.</p>
    <p>Mudryk was chased by Arsenal all window but in the end signed for Chelsea in a mega-money deal with a huge contract behind him.</p>
    <p>He was given minutes today off the bench and in the main, looked impressive. 
    Mudryk got at James Milner as soon as he came on and managed to create a few big chances for the Blues near the end. 
    His dribbling and touch looked excellent and there’s a lot to be excited about for Chelsea fans.</p>

    <p>Of course, Arsenal fans will have been watching on with interest. 
    As were a number of pundits, including Gary Neville, who admitted he’d have no interest in playing against the Ukrainian if he was still playing.</p>
