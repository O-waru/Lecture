    <h1>Jenas reacts as Mudryk makes debut after snubbing Arsenal
    </h1>

    <p>Jermaine Jenas has taken to Twitter to suggest that <b>Arsenal</b> should have made sure that they got a deal for Mykhaylo Mudryk across the line after his debut for Chelsea in their draw on Saturday.</p>
    <p>
        After months of links with a move to the Emirates, Mudryk ended up joining the Blues this month. Chelsea have paid <strong>Â£88.5 million</strong> for the Ukraine international.
    </p>

    <p>
        They would have known that there was a real chance that they would rue missing out. But had they been totally convinced about a deal, 
        you would imagine that they would have never got into a situation where the door was left open for <i>Chelsea</i>.
